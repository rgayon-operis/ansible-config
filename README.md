# Ansible Configuration
This is my ansible configuration file.

To install it, just clone this repo, and make a symbolic link to it inside your home.

Here's an example where the project folder is just installed inside a directory in your home.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rgayon-operis/ansible-config.git ~/.ansible-config
ln -s ~/.ansible.cfg ~/.ansible-config/.ansible.cfg
```
